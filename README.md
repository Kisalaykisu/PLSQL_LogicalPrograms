# PLSQL_LogicalPrograms

   PL/SQL is a procedural language designed specifically to embrace SQL statements within its syntax. 
   PL/SQL program units are compiled by the Oracle Database server and stored inside the database. 
   And at run-time, both PL/SQL and SQL run within the same server process, bringing optimal efficiency. 
   PL/SQL automatically inherits the robustness, security, and portability of the Oracle Database.
